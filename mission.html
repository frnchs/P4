          Insects create a notable impact within the biosphere everyday, yet they are often viewed as a nuisance. They are especially met with hostility in metropolitan cities like Newark, presenting an urgent need for members of the community to understand their intricacies. The main objective of the website, Insects at New Jersey Institute of Technology, is to showcase the rich variety of insects found on the NJIT campus. The comprehensive content offered by this website will foster a relationship between Newark residents and their insectile cohabitants. Insects at New Jersey Institute of Technology is intended for both insect aficionados and rookies alike, particularly those who frequent the surrounding areas of NJIT. The page will feature local insects in candid settings, which may likely garner the most appeal from individuals belonging to the aforementioned demographic. In order to attract broader engagement, the page will be formatted to resemble a college informational packet, written in first person by the insects themselves. Although the website primarily caters to young scholars from NJIT, it will be made suitable for all visitors to enjoy. Insects live in locations that suit their needs best. Temperature, climate, weather, and other unique circumstances constitute factors which decide where an insect resides. The website will include a section entitled, “Why We Chose NJIT”, outlining apparent factors during insect sightings. Additional topics highlighted by the website include insect profiles, fun facts, media, and roles in the ecosystem. Readers should know that an appreciation for insects will not manifest itself overnight. They are encouraged to embrace whatever compelled them to visit the page, whether their interest stemmed from curiosity or humor. The sole responsibility appointed to readers after browsing is to apply their novel knowledge of insects in any way they please.
