          Bumblebees often fly in air temperatures as low as 10oC or lower, yet they cannot take off unless their flight muscles are above 30oC, and the temperature of the thorax during flight must be maintained between 30o and 40o C regardless of ambient temperature.

          This insect was accidentally introduced into Pennsylvania and was confirmed in the state in September 2014. At first it was only found in Berks County, however, today it has spread throughout Pennsylvania and to neighboring states, including New Jersey.

        <blockquote cite="http://">
          Look closely enough, and you’ll find that modern societies resemble those of certain ants much more than our nearest relatives, the chimpanzee and bonobo. No chimp has to create highways, traffic rules, and infrastructure; participate in assembly lines and complex teamwork; or allocate a labor force for effective division of labor — the list goes on.
